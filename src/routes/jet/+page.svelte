        <h2>Hello, my name is Jet</h2>
        <p>I am a Black Labrador, I started out my life with Durham Police as a tiny puppy, I originally started out my time in the police training to be a search dog, but because I had such good skills working with people I was transferred to work with my handler Claire.</p>
        <p>So, I am now a Community Engagement dog for Durham Constabulary.</p>
        <p>I love my job now; as every day is such fun; I get to visit lots of new places and meet lots of interesting new people; but I also help to keep people safe and that is extremely important.</p>
        <p>I guess you would like to know more about me, well I work as part of a team with my colleague Ben and Claire.</p>

        <p>I am the wild one though, I love to run all the time and when I go to any new places I get so excited that there are times I cannot help but scream.</p>
        <p>My favourite thing in the whole wide world is a tennis ball, I love; love; love tennis balls, I ask for a new one every birthday.</p>
        <p>I also love going for long walks as exercise is good for me and keeps me fit and healthy.</p>
        <p>I live at home with my handler Claire, the family and my teammate Ben, since I am the youngest, I do like to annoy Ben sometimes; but isnâ€™t that what all younger siblings do.</p>
        <p>I love working with Claire as since I have been here she is helping me to learn new skills like how to be a wellbeing dog; so not only will I be helping members of the public.</p>
        <p>I will also be helping the police officers and staff I work with to think about their own wellbeing when dealing with traumatic incidents and sometimes my colleagues do have deal with some very difficult things and it is brilliant that I can help them.</p>

      <p>Well I think that is everything you need to know about me.</p>
      <p>Bye for now</p>
